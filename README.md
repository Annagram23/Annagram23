## Hi there, I'm Anna! 👋
---
### I’m a Full-Stack Software Developer
---
<p>A former teacher, I am a career- changer, who has completed intensive training in Full-Stack Software Development and moved into a role as a junior software engineer in the civil service. My bootcamp at the School of Code culminated in building an application in 4-weeks and presenting it to Tech professionals in the industry. The promo video for the app, ‘The Reading Room’ can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjjdsl9NvZU. I have also completed a course on Data and SQL with the charity Code First Girls. 
  I have worked as a Special Educational Needs teacher and a Primary Teacher and have a Master’s degree in Educational Leadership. I’m passionate about accessibility and have excellent skills in facilitation and collaboration. 
  I'm so excited to be on this journey; I am enjoying the process of learning and building useful things, that make our lives easier!
