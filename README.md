### Hi there, I'm Anna! 👋
---
## I’m a Full-Stack Software Developer
---
<p>I’ve recently completed the School of Code Bootcamp in Full-Stack Software Development. It culminated in building an application in 4-weeks and presenting it to Tech professionals in the industry. The promo video for the app, ‘The Reading Room’ can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjjdsl9NvZU 

I have worked as a Special Educational Needs teacher and have a Master’s degree in Educational Leadership. I’m passionate about accessibility and have excellent skills in facilitation and collaboration. 

I’m so excited to be on this journey, switching careers to Software Development and enjoying the process of learning and building useful things that make our lives easier!</p>
